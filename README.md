-Click the middle mouse button to place an obstacle in a cell.
-Right click an agent or a wall to remove it, can also be held and dragged to delete multiple.
-Spacebar progresses the simulation, one press updates agent strategies with the next press moving them.
-Press R to toggle auto-run, scrolling up or down while this is enabled increases or decreases the speed.
